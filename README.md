# Cadmus.General.Parts

This solution contains the Cadmus general parts library derived from `Cadmus.Parts`, in the context of the general refactoring towards a more streamlined and modular system.

The library includes all the old parts with these additions:

- `HistoricalEventsPart`: historical events part.
- `MetadataPart`: generic metadata part.

No part or fragment ID has been changed.

## History

- 2022-01-09: added assertion to external IDs part. Accordingly, the corresponding bricks editor has been updated in the bricks shell project.
